\section{Method}

\subsection{Data Collection With Motion-Triggered Camera Traps}



\subsection{Common Species Tracking}

The large volume of data collected over the past three years allowed the use of more straightforward methods to recognize common species. For a balance between accuracy and efficiency, we used Yolov8l\cite{vargheseYOLOv8NovelObject2024}.

A voting strategy was employed to further improve the practical accuracy. 

\subsection{Rare Species Recognition}
